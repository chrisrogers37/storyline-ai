- have the bot send a channel message when it spins up / spins down (thin and clean)
- add a button or link that opens instagram, switches to the right profile, and opens the story posting page natively
- add bot commands to set Instagram username for the channels' operations
- add bot commands to add image metadata on a proposed post (name meme, etc.?. This may not be that useful...)
