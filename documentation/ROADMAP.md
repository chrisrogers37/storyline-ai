## Decision Log

### 2026-01-08: Bot Management Commands Added
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive Telegram bot commands for queue/system management
**Features Added**:
- `/pause` and `/resume` for operational control
- `/schedule`, `/clear` for queue management
- `/stats`, `/history`, `/locks` for visibility
**Rationale**:
- Reduces need for SSH access to Raspberry Pi
- Enables team members to manage posting schedule
- Smart overdue handling prevents post flooding after pause
- All operations logged for audit trail
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All 7 commands implemented with 26 new tests

### 2026-01-05: Permanent Reject Feature Implemented
**Decision**: Add "Permanent Reject" as Priority 0 blocker before other Phase 1.5 work
**Rationale**:
- User has mixed media folders (some files should NEVER be posted)
- Current "Skip" button doesn't prevent media from being queued again
- Can't safely run system in production without way to permanently block files
- Blocks actual usage and testing of the system
- Simple implementation (2-3 hours), high value
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Implemented with infinite TTL locks (NULL locked_until)

### 2026-01-04: Instagram Deep Link Strategy
**Decision**: Keep simple `https://www.instagram.com/` link for now
**Rationale**:
- URLgenius flagged as phishing by Phantom wallet
- Current solution works and saves time
- Workflow instructions guide users effectively
- Can revisit with self-hosted solution later
**Status**: Added to backlog as future enhancement

### 2025-12-XX: Two-Phase Approach
**Decision**: Build Telegram-only mode first (Phase 1), Instagram API second (Phase 2)
**Rationale**:
- Faster time to value
- Test workflow before automation
- Avoid Instagram API complexity initially
- Manual mode is valuable on its own
